Weather App
Project Overview
This project is a simple weather application that fetches and displays weather data for a user-specified city using the OpenWeatherMap API. The application consists of three separate files:

index.html - HTML structure
style.css - Styling for UI/UX
script.js - JavaScript logic for fetching and displaying weather data
API Used
API Provider: OpenWeatherMap
Endpoint:
https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city name}&appid={API key}&units=metric
Purpose: Retrieves current weather data, including temperature, humidity, and weather description.
Reason for Choosing: OpenWeatherMap provides free access to real-time weather data with a simple API integration.
Testing the Implementation
Open index.html in a browser.
Enter a city name and click the Get Weather button.
Ensure the page displays the temperature, humidity, and weather description.
Error Handling:
Try entering an invalid city name (e.g., "Kovilpatti") to see if an error message appears.
Disconnect from the internet and test how the app handles network errors.
Enhancements & Future Improvements
Add icons representing different weather conditions.
Improve UI/UX with animations and better layout.
Enable location-based weather retrieval using the Geolocation API.
Show additional data like air pressure.
Conclusion
This project successfully fetches and displays weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API. The implementation follows best practices for clean code, error handling, and responsive design.
